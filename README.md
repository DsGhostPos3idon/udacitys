# Udacity Nanodegree Programms

This repository contains all the graded projects I completed for the Udacity Nanodegree Programs in 2021. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

I chose Udacity because it offers many interesting courses and endless possibilities. My goal was to learn Data Science and Machine Learning with a solid theoretical foundation. I followed “The Data Science Hierarchy of Needs” from bottom to top and selected courses related to each topic. The total duration of the courses is 26 months (assuming 10 hours/week).

__Note:__ Udacity reviewers provide valuable feedback even after passing a project. I am still working on implementing most of it.
